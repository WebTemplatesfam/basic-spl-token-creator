## Additional Information

- This project is designed for local use, and your wallet's secret key is not stored or transmitted over the internet. It's important to keep your wallet's secret key secure and never share it with anyone. The token creation process is entirely local, and your wallet's secret key is only used for transaction signing within the script.
